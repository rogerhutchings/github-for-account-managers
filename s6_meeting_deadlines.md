# Section 6 - Meeting a client deadline

In the last section, we looked at how to identify a problem &ndash; like a bug, or a client-requested change &ndash; and describe it to a developer so they can fix it.

But like the proverbial buses, client amends rarely come alone. To group multiple issues together and give them a deadline, we can use GitHub's __milestones__.

In traditional project management, a milestone marks the end of a package of work, or the end of a project phase.<sup>1</sup> The end of work might coincide with shipping or deploying a project, or there might be a period in between to allow for testing.

In GitHub terms, a milestone is a container for issues, with a due date attached to it. Issues are assigned to a milestone, and as they are closed, the milestone's progress moves toward 100%. When the miletstone hits 100%, it can be closed. And that's as complicated as it gets.

> An issue without a milestone has no urgency. If you need an issue closed by a certain date, __it has to be part of a milestone__.

## Creating and managing milestones

### Creating a new milestone

1. On the issues screen, click the `Milestones` tab at the top left of the pane.
2. If you have no open milestones, you can create on by clicking the link in the middle. Otherwise, click the `Create a new milestone` button on the left.

2. And that's it! You can also add an issue to a milestone from the issue's own page, by clicking on the `Milestone` section of the right-hand bar.

### Viewing the issues in a milestone

You can filter out issues that aren't in your milestone.

1. In the issues list, click on the gear drop-down in the `Milestone` area in the left-hand bar, and choose your milestone.
